 well I'm back from Boston. Like the layout? I made it on the plane... between princess mononoke and spirited away. Looks spiffy huh? Not quite sure if I'm going to revert to my 'calling card' blue and grey... Give me feedback people. Today my friend Steve from Michigan said something worth posting:

 steve: man, you need a girl

 rts: curious, why do you say that?

 steve: too many monitors :D
