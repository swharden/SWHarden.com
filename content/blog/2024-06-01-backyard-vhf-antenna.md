**This article describes how I created an outdoor VHF antenna for my backyard that has been serving me well for the last few months.**  My primary goals for this antenna are that it would (1) stand up to outdoor weather, (2) be as visually unobtrusive as possible so as not to attract more attention than necessary, (3) reliably hit a repeater 30 miles away, and (4) be relatively easy to remove if I decide to move.

**I achieved a surprisingly good outcome by placing a mobile antenna with a ground plane kit on a piece of conduit covered with camouflage spray paint.**  I used the mobile antenna and ground plane because I had both on hand and I appreciated the low visibility of the thin wires. However, a base antenna like a Diamond X50 would be a simpler and less expensive option which could offer improved performance. I'm sharing information about my build in the hopes that it will be informative to others considering building something similar.

**I started by mounting the antenna on the mast.** The pole mount that came with the artificial ground plane was too large to fit flush against the 3/4" conduit so I used small hose clamps as spacers before clamping it down. I ran the coax through the center of the conduit, tightened everything down, and spray-painted everything black.

**I then created a strong base pole.** I dug a hole, pushed the 5' conduit as deep as I could by hand (about 3ft), surrounded it with pea gravel, and poured in a couple pounds of cement using a level to ensure it set vertically. My goal was to mostly stabilize the setup against moderate wind, not to make it permanent. The cement is only a couple feet down, so I assume it will be straightforward to remove with a shovel if I need to.

**Once the anchor set I used U bolts to clamp it to the mast, then I spray-painted everything camouflage.** I didn't need to paint the vertical element because it was already black, but I covered the radials and masts with alternating colors of dark camouflage spray paint. I hadn't used camouflage spray paint before, and I was impressed with how flat (matte) the outcome was. The splotches from the alternating colors look remarkably like patches of sunlight hitting it through the leaves.

**I surrounded the base with a camouflage painted cement block and buried the coax a few inches deep.** This was necessary because the exposed coax comes out of the base of the mast, and I didn't want it to have exposure from direct sunlight or get accidentally engaged by a weed eater. I added lightning protection where the coax enters the house using an inline lighting arrester connected to a ground rod. I understand that best practice is to additionally ground the base of the antenna mast itself, but considering its relatively low height and location beneath trees, lightning risk seems pretty low.

**Altogether this project came out great!** In the end it was a bit more expensive than I originally predicted to assemble (big surprise) but the performance and reliability is fantastic and I'm highly satisfied with the outcome. The biggest take-home lessons from this project were (1) Lowe's conduit is a cheap way to elevate an antenna and (2) camouflage spray paint goes a long way toward hiding silver structures.
