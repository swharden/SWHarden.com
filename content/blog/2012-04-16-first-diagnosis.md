# First Diagnosis

**In April 2012 I had some alarming symptoms and visited an oncologist for the first time.** Symptoms included lymphadenopathy, weight loss, night sweats. This picture was taken just before my first doctor visit, and I’m in scrubs because I was a dental student at the time (I hadn’t started the DMD/PhD program yet). After several blood tests and two surgical biopsies I was eventually diagnosed with [non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)](https://g.co/kgs/yBJEYd). More specifically, Lennert’s Lymphoma, a rare lymphoepithelioid variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the [not otherwise specified category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_T-cell_lymphoma_not_otherwise_specified) T-cell lymphomas.

**I found one of K. Lennert’s [early publications](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/68/3/663.full.pdf) from 1986 especially interesting.** There are earlier publications, but this one is open-access. Its title describes condition as “a monoclonal proliferation of helper T cells“, and in its text further characterizes it as “special variant of Hodgkin’s disease characterized by a high percentage of epithelioid cells and rarely containing the Reed-Sternberg cells characteristic of classical Hodgkin’s disease.”
