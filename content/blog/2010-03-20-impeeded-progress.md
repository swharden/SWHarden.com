# Impeded Progress

__Spring break is over__ and dental school classes have resumed. An unexpected side-effect of spending all of spring break working so hard on my [QRSS VD software project](https://github.com/swharden/QRSS-VD) is that when I resumed dental school, I actually feel more relaxed. It's like spring break was my period of intense work, and the rest of dental school is my "break". It makes me a little disappointed though - I feel like dental school isn't pushing me very hard, and I don't feel like I'm learning or growing like I could be. With the estimated cost of tuition totaling ~$200,000 for four years of dental school, I'd have expected classes to feel a little less trite. Anyhow, it is what it is, and I'll make the best of it.

__I'm spending the weekend polishing-up code and reading circuit diagrams.__ I have a few projects on my plate (involving QRSS in some way or another) and I'm managing the transition from productivity back to dental school the best I can...
