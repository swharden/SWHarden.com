# The Internet was Moved?

__I'm working late in lab__ (as usual) and I went to open Firefox (my default web browser), so I clicked Start and selected "Mozilla Firefox" at the top (where your default browser usually goes in XP). Nothing happened... then this message popped up! I had to take a screen shot because it's so bizarre.

<div class="text-center img-border">

I swear this is straight from my screen (PrntScrn -> mspaint (pasted) -> PNG) with no modifications. I especially love how the computer is trying to tell me what could have gone wrong; the internet might have been moved, renamed, or removed. Slick.
