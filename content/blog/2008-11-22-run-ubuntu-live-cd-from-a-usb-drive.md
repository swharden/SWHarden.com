# Run Ubuntu Live CD From a USB Drive

 __I accidentally nuked my laptop's 80G hard drive this morning__ (D'OH!) while shuffling around partitions.  Supposedly there's a valid windows (XP) installation on there still that's about 20G.  I'd love to repair it so I can use it today while I'm in the confocal room, but I don't have an Ubuntu CD, Windows CD, or any CD for that matter!  I looked around, but I guess blank CD-Rs aren't something that's standard in molecular biology laboratories.  Anyhow, I wanted to install the new Ubuntu 8.10 Linux distribution, and I've downloaded the ISO, but since I can't find a CD to burn it to I decided to try booting from a USB drive (something I've never done before).  I found an _AWESOME_ program which specialized in putting ISO files onto bootable USB drives.  It's called [UNetBootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) and it's free (of course), runs on Linux or Windows,  and has some built-in options for various linux distributions.  I can repair my PC now!  Yay!
