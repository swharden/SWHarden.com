__I'm extremely excited about my new purchase!__  I found this on Craigslist of all places!  It's a [Tektronix 453](http://www.diyguitarist.com/TestEquipment/Tektronix453.htm) oscilloscope from the late 60s in pretty good condition.  I'm not going into a bunch of technical details about what I'm using it for, but let's just say I'm satisfied.  The 1khz square wave generator doesn't function and one of the lights is not working, but other than that it seems to be fine. Here are a couple pics:

__I've got to thank my wife Angelina__ for this scope!  It was my birthday gift this year.  I made it too easy for her by telling her exactly what I wanted and finding it on the internet!  Now I have to spend the next month trying to think of a gift for her without any hints [ponders]...

__Okay, back to work!__ Now that I'm up and running after a few months without a scope, I can't wait to see what I come up with.
