# PHP-Generated Apache-Style Access Logs

__A few months ago__ I wrote about a way [I use PHP to generate apache-style access.log files](https://swharden.com/static/2009/05/14/2009-01-22-using-php-to-create-apache-style-accesslog/) since my web host blocks access to them.  Since then I've forgotten it was even running!  I now have some pretty cool-looking graphs generated by [Python](http://www.python.org) and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/).  For details (and the messy script) check the original posting.

__This image represents__ the number of requests (php pages) made per hour since I implemented the script.  It might be a good idea to perform some [linear data smoothing techniques](http://www.swharden.com/blog/2008-11-17-linear-data-smoothing-in-python/) (which I love writing about), but for now I'll leave it as it is so it most accurately reflects the actual data.
