Hi ðŸ‘‹ 2003 Scott here! I stumbled upon a forgotten URL on the Wayback Machine that may be the oldest preserved trace of my life on the early internet. The page seen here was scraped on in Feb, 2000 when I was 14 years old. I recall working on an earlier version of this website using Microsoft FrontPage (the 1996 version) which had a blue background, and later I changed the style to green text on a black background to look more "hackerish". Unfortunately none of the links or images worked, but at least I was able to retrieve the home page.
