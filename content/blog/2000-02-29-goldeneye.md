Hi ðŸ‘‹ 2023 Scott here! I stumbled upon a forgotten URL on the Wayback Machine that may be the oldest preserved trace of my life on the early internet. The page seen here was archived on Feb, 2000 when I was 14 years old. I probably created this website using Microsoft FrontPage (the 1996 version). Earlier versions of this website had a blue water tiling background, but after watching The Matrix (on VHS, lol) I was inspired to redesign it with green text on a black background. Unfortunately none of the links or images were saved, but I am pleased to see that the Internet Archive was able to preserve the home page.
