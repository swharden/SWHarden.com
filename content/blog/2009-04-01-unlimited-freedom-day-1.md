# Post-Defense Day 1

__Two hours after getting home from work__ I'm already basking in the newfound carefreeness thanks to the successful completion of my thesis defense (and graduation requirements). Yesterday I went to SkyCraft, early this morning I posted a schematic diagram of a basic circuit concept for a radio/microphone interface box with tone generating functions, and this afternoon I finished its assembly. It's hacked together, I know, but it's just a prototype. What does it do? It's complicated. It's basically just an exercise in microchip programming.

__Here's the little setup__ with the main control unit and a DC to DC regulated power supply / serial microchip programmer I made.

__Here's the main control box.__ Notice the "2-way lighted switches" which I described in the previous entry. I found that proper grounding (floating pin prevention) was critical to their proper function. I'm still new to these chips, so I'm learning, but I'm making progress!

__Getting a little artsy__ with my photographs now... this is the core of the device. It's a picaxe 14m!

__This is a 5v regulated power supply__ I built. The headphone adapter is for easy connection to the serial port. It has a power switch and a program/run switch (allowing use of pin 13, serial out) while still "connected" to the PC.

I've slightly improved the connection between my radio's coax cable to the J-pole antenna I made.

__I'm able to get pretty good signals__ from this antenna, but it's probably not likely to do much to my assembly skills (and lack of tuning), and more likely due to the fact that I have an unobstructed view of middle/southern Orlando from the 3rd story of my apartment balcony. I could probably wire up a rubber duck on a stick and get good results with that location! I'll miss my reception when I move.
