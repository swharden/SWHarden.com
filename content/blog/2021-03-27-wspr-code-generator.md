**[WSPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)) (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter) is a protocol for weak-signal radio communication.** Transmissions encode a station's callsign, location (grid square), and transmitter power into a frequency-shift-keyed (FSK) signal that hops between 4 frequencies to send 162 tones in just under two minutes. Signals can be decoded with S/N as low as âˆ’34 dB! [WSJT-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html), the most commonly-used decoding software, reports decoded signals to [wsprnet.org](https://wsprnet.org/) so propagation can be assessed all over the world.

**[WsprSharp](https://github.com/swharden/WsprSharp) is a WSPR encoding library implemented in C#.** I created this library learn more about the WSPR protocol. I also made a web application (using Blazor WebAssembly) to make it easy to generate WSPR transmissions online: [WSPR Code Generator](https://swharden.com/software/wspr-code-generator)

### WSPR Transmission Information

![](https://swharden.com/static/2021/03/27/wspr-spectrogram.png)

* One packet is 110.6 sec continuous wave
* Frequency shifts between 4 tones 
* Each tone keys for 0.683 sec
* Tones are separated by 1.4648 Hz
* Total bandwidth is about 6 Hz
* 50 bits of information are packaged into a 162 bit message with [FEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code)
* Transmissions always begin 1 sec after even minutes (UTC)
