# Wideband Receiver Works!

__I demonstrated [earlier this week](http://www.swharden.com/blog/2011-02-09-minimal-radio-project-continues/) that I can generate a wide range of frequencies using a tank circuit and the oscillator in a SA612__. I added a little circuitry and hooked the receiver to my [homemade indoor 20m/40m dipole antenna](http://www.swharden.com/blog/2010-02-07-simple-diy-stealth-apartment-antenna-for-20m-and-40m/) and vwa la, audio emerges!  Endless improvements can be made, but it demonstrates the functionality of this simple circuit.
