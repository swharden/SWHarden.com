# Transmitting Around the World

__One of my recent fascinations__ __is QRSS, a super-low power mode of transmission over the airwaves.__ Picture this: get a [ham radio setup](http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~ted/graphics/ham_radio_station.jpeg) which outputs dozens of watts of power, use a microcontroller to transmit data (frequency-shifting Morse code), use FFT on the receive end to view it on the computer, now increase the time between the "beeps" to tens of seconds and decrease the power to milliwatts and receive the signal thousands of miles away - that's QRSS! How cool! I want to try this badly... but I have to get back to lab - I have a thesis to write!
