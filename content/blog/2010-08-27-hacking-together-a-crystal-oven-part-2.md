# Hacking Together a Crystal Oven Part 2

__With the last post's promising results,__ I set out to finish my crystal oven prototype and affix it to my QRSS MEPT prototype. If everything works well, I'm ready to publish the final schematic and parts lists! (and make several MEPTs for people who were interested in having one). I'm not confident my approach to the heater was the best, and am already thinking of ways I could have improved on its performance, but I think this just might work! I'll test it overnight (Styrofoam-enclosed vs. open air) and see how it does. I wonder if this is good enough to be used outside?
