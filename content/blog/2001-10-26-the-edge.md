Hi ðŸ‘‹ 2003 Scott here! I stumbled upon a forgotten URL on the Wayback Machine that shows some of my earliest surviving marks on the internet. It was scraped on in Oct, 2001 when I just turned 16. The page has a JavaScript fly-out menu but none of the links point to pages that were archived. I don't recall if "the edge" meant anything, other than a "branding" phase I went through briefly as an internet-surfing kid. The background of this site is `#003366` which is one of my favorite colors, even today!
