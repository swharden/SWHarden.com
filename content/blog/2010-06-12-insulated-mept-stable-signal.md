# MEPT Insulation Improves Stability

__While it may not be perfect__, it's a whole lot better. Below is a capture from this morning of my signal (the waves near the bottom). Compare that to how it was before and you should notice a dramatic improvement! The MEPT is inside a metal box inside a 1-inch-thick Styrofoam box. Very cool!
