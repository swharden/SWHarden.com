__The VD Labs web page has been published!__ I hope that the new VD Labs page will be a single location where I can link to descriptions and downloads of useful radio, audio analysis, and QRSS-related software. It will eventually be the home of the next (recorded-from-scratch) version of QRSS VD, but let's not get too far ahead of ourselves!

__Since I ran out of steam__ from working so much on QRSS VD, I didn't think I'd be publishing mush more "useful" software, but this one blind-sighted me. People on the Knights QRSS mailing list were talking about dividing QRSS transmissions into images which line up with the period of the transmitters repeated messages and projecting the images together in an attempt to average-out the noise, and boost the signal. It's a simple idea, and it's the basis behind how a lot of poor imaging devices can improve their output clarity by software (MRI anyone?). I was overwhelmed by dental school obligations the last few weeks, and it pained me so much to read what people were doing (or at least trying to do) and having to sit it out. Now that I have a free day (yay for weekends!) I sat down and wrote some code. I introduce VD Labs QRSS Stitcher and QRSS Stacker!
