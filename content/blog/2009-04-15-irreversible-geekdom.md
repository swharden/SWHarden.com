# Scott is now Licensed! (KJ4LDF)

__I've taken the plunge__ into the geek world by becoming a licensed amateur radio operator. My wife and I both took our technician exam last week, and this morning I discovered that our call signs have been processed. I'm KJ4LDF, she's KJ4LDG. I'm a little disappointed that my call sign has an "F" in it. On the air, "F" and "S" sound similar, so I'm more likely to have people asking me to repeat it. The phonetics are Kilo, Juliet, Four, Lima, Delta, Foxtrot. Foxtrot! How silly is that? [sighs] Either way, I'm glad I've been added to the database, and am now legally able to begin broadcasting on VHF/UHF.

Beacon stuff (like I wrote about in the last post) would best involve lower frequencies, which would mean I have to take another exam to get a higher license class.
