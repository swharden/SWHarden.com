__Last night I had the honor of speaking for GARS,__ the Gainesville Amateur Radio Society. Their club call (K4GNV) is used by the 146.820 MHz FM repeater (the most active in Gainesville).  There were a few dozen attendees, and it was interesting to give a lecture on advanced radio topics to a body that had a lot of experience with RF. This group was a couple generations older and a lot more experienced and than the groups of students I'm used to speaking for! Overall it went well and I'm glad I had the opportunity to present. It's probably one of those things I'll remember for quite some time.

__The talk was an overview of QRSS, WSPR, and ultra-narrowband data transmission__, with a focus on home made transmitters and simple radio/PC/software receiving stations. I did a little more research into WSPR in the process of preparing for it (including familiarizing myself with the details of how the data is encoded into 4 tones) and I am glad I understand more about the mode than I did before I started. I grinned as I showed a few slides of [Hans Summers' kit pictures](http://www.hanssummers.com/qrsskit). I wonder if anyone in the group will buy one? I hope so!
