# Vector-Based Racing Game?

 __While searching for a more__ efficient band-pass filter for python (to apply to multi-hour WAV files because the WAV->FFT->bandstop->iFFT->smooth process is way too slow) I came across [The Stoic Monkey's VROOM!](http://www.stoicmonkey.com/category/vroom/) which apparently is a vector-based racing game game (written in Python with PyGame libraries) .  It doesn't flaunt the [capabilities of PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/screenshots.html) for game design, but it was a cool concept because it's very 3D-ish and is done by mathematically processing anti-aliasing splines at impressively high speed.  Check it out!  http://www.stoicmonkey.com/vroom/VROOM_setup.exe
