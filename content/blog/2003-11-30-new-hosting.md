 yeah, that's right.  Finally! Off my crappy internet connection! Woohoo!

 I'm not 100% sure I'm going to be using this company... but things are really slick so far.  I feel pretty good about these guys =o)  So far, they've been treating me really well and been great people to work with.... more info later.

 It'll be at least a day or two before I can move my whole website over to this new host... I have a TON of  server-specific code I wrote since I never dreamed I'd move to a _real_ host... (never would have imagined my site would get so big).  So, gimme a few days, see what happens...
