# First QRSS Spot!

__I'm so excited!__ This little transmitter I made and programmed to transmit my call sign (AJ4VD) and a picture of a gator got its first spotting tonight! I'm so excited. It was reported by [W4HBK](http://www.qsl.net/w4hbk/W4HBKgrabber.html) in Pensacola, FL. It's only 300 miles away, but it's a start! I'm keeping my fingers crossed and maybe someday soon I'll hear from Europe.
