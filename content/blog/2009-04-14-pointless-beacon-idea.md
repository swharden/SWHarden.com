The author wants to create a beacon that will keep everything inside it in pristine working condition by protecting against various environmental factors, including rain, heat, snow, hurricanes, and possibly even Florida panthers and bears, while also allowing light to enter through a glass or plexiglas window to charge a battery housed within the device.
