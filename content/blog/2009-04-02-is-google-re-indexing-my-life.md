# Is Google Re-Indexing My Life?

 __After several years__ of persistent writing on this website I was forced (by my undergraduate university's difficult course loads) to stop adding to this blog - something I consider to be one of the most significant projects I've ever worked on, with brain-to-text recordings of my thoughts spanning almost a decade of time.  After a few years of suspended writing, Google went from loving me (sending me thousands of page views daily) to forgetting about me (nothing. silence. nada.).  Now that my thesis requirements have been completed, I'm trying to re-energize my writing in an attempt to document the projects I work on which, without this website, would likely be forever forgotten even by me.  It appears that the burst of new writing has regained Google's attention.  Google for terms such as "data smoothing in python" and it favors my site.  Google is slowly, but surely, re-indexing my pages and assigning them values of relevance which are approaching (but still a tiny fraction of) what they were before my hiatus.  Here's a chart from google's analytics demonstrating an estimation of IP visits per day (visitors) and their locations.
