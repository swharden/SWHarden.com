**[FTFlash](https://github.com/swharden/FTFlash) is a Windows application for reading and writing SPI flash memory with a FT232H breakout board.** I created FTFlash to be an easy to use click-to-run alternative to existing strategies that use console applications, complex python distributions, or custom USB drivers. FTFlash [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/swharden/FTFlash) and a zip file containing the EXE can be downloaded from the [FTFlash releases page](https://github.com/swharden/FTFlash/releases). This page demonstrates interfacing a [W25Q32](https://www.elinux.org/images/f/f5/Winbond-w25q32.pdf), but the strategies described here should work for any SPI flash chip.

FT232H | Flash Module | Description
---|---|---
D0|CLK|Clock - Idles low, levels are sampled on the rising edge
D1|MOSI|Master Out Serial In - FT232H shifts data to the module
D2|MISO|Master In Serial Out - FT232H reads data from the module
D3|CS|Cable Select - Idles high, FT232H pulls low to initiate commands
5V|3.3V|Use a regultor (like L78L33) to conver 5V to 3.3V

## Screenshots

**The test window is used for learning about the connected chip.** It can read device IDs, read/write specific memory addresses, and erase the full chip. Use this window to confirm that your device is connected and can be communicated with.

> ðŸ’¡ **You cannot write to an address multiple times without erasing it first!** Programming bytes in flash memory can only flip bits from `1` to `0`, and erasing flash memory sets resets all bytes to `0xFF`.

**The programming window** is for reading and writing large amounts of data to and from `.bin` files on the local disk. Binary files can be viewed and edited with hex editors such as [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/).

## Read/Write SPI Flash with a Bus Pirate

**I use my old school [Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate) (v3) any time I start interfacing a chip I haven't worked with before.** The Bus Pirate appears as a USB serial port you can communicate with to send arbitrary SPI or I<sup>2</sup>C commands. It has a built-in power supply that can deliver 5V and 3.3V too. It's great way to practice interfacing with unfamiliar chips without having to use a breadboard or write any software.

### Bus Pirate Setup

* I'm using [RealTerm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/), display `Ansi`, Baud `115200`, Port `5`
* `#` - Reset
* `m` - Set mode
* `5` - SPI
* `1` - 30 KHz
* `1` - Clock idle: low
* `2` - Output clock edge: active to idle
* `1` - Input sample phase: middle
* `2` - CS active: low
* `2` - Output type: normal (3.3V/GND)
* `W` - Turn on power supply (3.3V)

### Bus Pirate Commands

* reset: `[0x66][0x99]`
* read manufacturer and device ID: `[0x90,0,0,0,r:2]`
* read unique ID: `[0x4B,0,0,0,0,r:8]`
* chip erase:`[6][0xC7]`
* write 2 bytes at memory address zero: `[6][2,0,0,0,42,69]`
* read 8 bytes from memory address zero: `[3,0,0,0,r:8]`

> ðŸ’¡ **You cannot write to an address multiple times without erasing it first!** Programming bytes in flash memory can only flip bits from `1` to `0`, and erasing flash memory sets resets all bytes to `0xFF`.

* [Programming SPI flash with an FT232H breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-spi-flash-prom-with-an-ft232h-breakout/overview) (Adafruit) recommends using [ftdiflash](https://github.com/adafruit/ftdiflash/), a console app I found to be poorly documented and hard to use. _Update: The console -h output doesn't indicate how to write a binary file to the flash device. The linked website does, but not in text, it's documented as characters in a screenshot of a terminal window. It seems to be as simple as `ftdiflash.exe file.bin` but I didn't realize this until later. It also doesn't work with the standard FTDI drivers and requires a third party app "Zadig" to switch the system FTDIBUS driver to libusbK. What a mess._

* [Adafruit's FT232H Breakout page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ft232h-breakout/windows-setup) describes actions that require Python 2 which was deprecated at the end of 2019.

* [CircuitPython Libraries on any Computer with FT232H](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h) (Adafruit) describes how to program SPI FLASH chips with CircuitPython, but the documentation is fragmented across [multiple](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/running-circuitpython-code-without-circuitpython) [web](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/setup) [pages](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/windows) [which](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/troubleshooting) [I find](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/pinouts) [super](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/examples) [unhelpful](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/gpio) and this seems like such a simple task that I don't want to setup a whole Python environment just to pass some bytes.
