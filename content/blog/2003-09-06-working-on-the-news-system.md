 work with me here!  Before I add new posts, I'm working backwards adding old ones.  I'll write here soon - give me time to work  (add to the tagboard what you think of the new news system)

 I know what you're thinking - "scott, why a new news system?" and/or "scott, it looks horrible".

 well, to the first one, this new system will be a lot easier to work with and more flexable

 to the second, this new news system will be easier to theme.  Once I get it working right, i'll spend some time to make it look nice
