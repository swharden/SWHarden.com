__Last weekend was field day__, a disaster simulation / competition for amateur radio operators. In a sentence, people are encouraged to make as many contacts as they can around the world (earning points) using emergency radio preparations (battery and solar powered radios, temporary antennas, etc) for a full 24 hours (2pm to 2pm). I spent the time with the [UCF Amateur Radio Club](http://www.k4ucf.ucf.edu) who set up [big antennas](http://www2.mmae.ucf.edu/wiki/Image:Fd2008pract_1289.jpg) in a grassy field on campus. It was a fun experience, and the first time I ever got to see a HF rig in operation. A representative for the UCF newspaper showed up, took some interviews, and I ended-up being [quoted in the article](http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/ucf-club-participates-in-ham-radio-field-day-1.1770219). I can also be seen in the photo, if you look close enough (yellow square).

__Being that amateur radio was something I got into independently (I didn't know anyone else with a license) I was (and still am) very isolated in the hobby.__ I'm really thankful I found the UCF ARC, even though it wasn't until I'd already been going to UCF for 2 years and was already on my way out. Seeing (and actually get to use) a HF rig was an eye-opening experience for me, and one I'm a little regretful I participated in. Before yesterday, I had already come to terms with my situation (going to dental school in a few weeks and virtually dropping all of my hobbies) and was content with my summer accomplishments so far. My summer goal was to get into radio, and before yesterday I felt I had. I studied for my exam, got my license, learned how to use repeaters on VHF to easily make local contacts, and I was satisfied. I knew HF was out there, and that it allowed communication over thousands of miles, but I ignored it knowing I wouldn't get into it this summer (the equipment is just too expensive for me to justify purchasing). Now, after sitting in front of a rig for several hours, I wish I had the time to upgrade my license, earn a little cash to blow on a HF radio, and spend a few weeks sitting in front of it scouring the waves for random voices around the world. I know it's a little morbid, but I'd probably have to compare the feeling I'm experiencing with what an old person feels like when they realize their end is near and that they won't be able to do the things they always dreamed they would. Oh well, at least I'll be able to fill holes in teeth soon. \[smiles convincingly\]

After the tents, antennas, and radios were mostly set up, everyone was exhausted. I was ready to make some contacts! I fired-up my 'ol netbook and tried communicating over 40m using psk (a digital mode), a mode I've never used, with software I've never used, on a band I've never used. It wasn't working either. I spent the first _several_ hours in frustration because what I was trying to do wasn't working, and I couldn't figure out why. This photo was taken at the height of my frustration.
