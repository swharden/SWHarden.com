# Spring Break Software Project

__Wow, I can't believe I took-on such a massive challenge this week!__ Ironically I've worked harder and learned more in the last 4 days than I have over the last 9 months of dental school. This is an incredible feeling of accomplishment. My program, coded from scratch, polls the sound card continuously and makes extremely large spectrographs. It's not finished, but it's working. I'm impressed!

**Note from Future Scott (ten years later, August 2019):**

I remember this day! It was the first time I completed a big software project, and it was a great feeling. It motivated me to continue working on software for years to come. I also got a kick out of this quote from early-dental-student Scott: _"I've worked harder and learned more in the last 4 days than I have over the last 9 months of dental school."_
