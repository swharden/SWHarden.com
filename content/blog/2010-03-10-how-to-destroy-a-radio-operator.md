# How to Destroy a Radio Operator

__After priding myself on my ingenuity__ a few weeks ago for documenting my [homemade stealth indoor apartment antenna for 40m and 20m](http://www.swharden.com/blog/2010-02-07-simple-diy-stealth-apartment-antenna-for-20m-and-40m/), it seems that the green movement has contrived a plan to cripple my successes. So far I've made a few dozen contacts in Morse code with my humble little setup (~20 watts of power, direct conversion receiver, indoor homemade antenna). The photo shows some QSL cards I've gotten. Anyhow, my apartment manager decided that my apartment needed to have solar panels added to it. It's too early to tell for sure, but spinning the dial a few times and hearing \*nothing\* makes me think that it dramatically impacted my reception (and likely transmission) in a dramatic way.

There are the QSL cards I got so far:

I think the AJ4VD station has been effectively shut down!
