__Now that my minimalist QRSS transmitter is mostly functional, I'm shifting gears toward building a minimalist receiver.__ These are some early tests, but I'm amazed I managed to hack something together that actually works! Once it's finished I'll post schematics. For now, here are some photos. This receiver is based upon an SA602 and although there \*IS\* an op-amp on the board, I actually bypassed it completely! The SA602 seems to put out enough juice to make my PC microphone jack happy, and those cheap op-amps are noisy anyway, so awesome! Go minimalism!

__Here's the output from 7.040 MHz.__ Conditions are pretty bad right now, and I'm at my apartment using my crazy indoor antenna
