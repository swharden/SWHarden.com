__Yesterday was__ the notorious "injection lab" where 80 second-year dental students practice injecting on patients (classmates) for the first time. We all performed 5 injections blocking different nerves, some seemed more invasive than others.  It was an interesting day I will probably remember. The photo is of my classmate (Steven) giving his first injection to me! Surprisingly it didn't hurt as much as I expected.

__After the event__ I went to a GARC (Gator Amateur Radio Club) meeting and then to a workshop I'm helping lead in the engineering building. The specific direction of the workshop is still emerging, but it's in the realm of home-brew radio devices. I took some of the equipment I've made and several people seemed interested in potentially working with me on my projects. It would be wonderful to have actual engineers working on these electrical projects!
