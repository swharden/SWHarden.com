Hey looks like I wrote the previous section today... weird... oh well. here I go! Today I started researching and I was all bumbed out because Yahoo! changed their ad policies for the personal home pages. It used to me that they could put a geocities ad at the bottom of the page (like a full size banner) and it would stay there. Your only other option was to accept the annoying "ad square" at the top right of the screen. Well I've always liked the "geo bar" (they called it) because it doesn't pop-up at you and it looks nicer on a webpage... well Geocities didn't like it. They said that someone can add the ad at the bottom of the page if they want to, but there's now going to be a pop-up "ad square" no matter what. Great! How annoying! For the longest time I played with the HTML code - back and forth - uploading and downloading. Finally I figured it stood up to the name "unhackable" because I realized they add a chunk of HTML in the code to make it happen... so I had to think of a different way to hide this. Well, I figured it out - a fool proof everlasting good-for-all script that I can add to make the ad go away (mostly) see the little 3 pixel wide bar on the right side? I'm workin' on it... ok I'm adding this 20 mins later. I fixed it! Now there is no banner snowing at all.... isn't life great? :o)
