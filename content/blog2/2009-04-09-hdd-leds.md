**I was poking around the internet looking at various ways people made smooth-fading LED circuits** and I came across the site of a guy who did something pretty creative that made me smile. Before I got too far, I wanted to mention that I saw a ton of plans involving fading LED intensity utilizing 555 timer ICs, but for my purposes a series capacitor before the LED should do fine. [Here's the site](http://metku.net/index.html?path=mods/hdd_eyez/index_eng) which documents the project. Basically it's a skull with red LED eyes which glow in response to hard drive activity. The capacitor makes the eyes fade in and out smoothly, as opposed to the jerky on/off flashing of standard hard drive activity LEDs. Very clever!
