# woohoo! server's up

 Allright, lets see. BSD is now installed and stable running apache and php4 with MySQL to provide a cozy little 180 Gb webserver (across 3 drives). I have written a basic website, wrote the shoutbox, and just finished setting up news. Hopefully this will make it easier to post more often! Oh yeah, all this cool computer stuff.. its running on a computer that's 233mhz with 64 megs of ram. :D
