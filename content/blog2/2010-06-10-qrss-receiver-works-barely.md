__I completed work on my first RF receiver__, and for what it is it seems to work decently. It should be self-explanatory from the photos. It's based around an SA602. As with everything, I don't plan on posting schematics until the project is complete because I don't want people re-creating junky circuits! It's stationed at the University of Florida's club station W4DFU and its spectrograph can be viewed in real time from the [__QRSS VD - Web Grabber - W4DFU__](http://ham.w4dfu.ufl.edu:8080/qrss_vd/website/) page.
