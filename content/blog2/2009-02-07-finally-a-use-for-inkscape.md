title: InkScape to the Rescue!

__After a few weeks of using InkScape,__ slowly working through documentation, tutorials, and practicing drawing random objects, I think I'm finally getting the feel of designing images in InkScape, and am growing to appreciate the depth of its usefulness. I'd love to have some great diagrams to include in potential publications. For example, I want a diagram to show how the autonomic nervous system innervates the mouse heart, but no such diagram exists! [Here's one for humans](http://www.demosschiropractic.com/illus/autonomic-nervous-system.gif) but it's major overkill, shows every organ (I only want the heart), and doesn't go into detail as to what the nerves do when they reach the heart (something I'm researching). Also, [mouse brains](http://tedhuntington.com/Mouse_brain.jpg) are very different in shape from human brains, and there aren't any good pictures of the ventral side of a mouse brain. So, I found the best one I could and re-created it with InkScape.

I used an existing image as a reference, made half a brain, and can mirror it when I'm done. It looks pretty good, right?
