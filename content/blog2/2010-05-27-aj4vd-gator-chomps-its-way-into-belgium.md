# AJ4VD Gator Chomps its way into Belgium!

__Yeah, that's over 4,500 miles away!__ The following image was captured from [ON5EX's QRSS grabber](http://www.on5ex.be/grabber/grabber.html) in Belgium! Amazing. I don't have the equipment to measure its power output, but it's running on USB power and I'd assume it's putting out less than 100mW. Very cool!
