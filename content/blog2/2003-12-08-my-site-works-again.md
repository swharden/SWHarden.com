woohoo!  and... /yawn/  It's 1:57am in the morning and I have work tomorrow.

I just got done writing a paper.  8 pages + research in 2 hours this late at night is good time for me because I'm slow at night ^_^;

I can't write tonight, I will tomorrow... so... I'll give you some pics to look at ^_-
