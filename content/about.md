**I'm Scott W Harden, and this is my personal website.** I use this space to share personal projects I work on and as a place to aggregate notes and documentation I collect along the way. My formal education is in biotechnology, dentistry, and neuroscience, but I am passionate about computer programming, electrical engineering, and enjoy contributing to and maintaining a variety of open source hardware and software projects.

## Medical Updates

**I was diagnosed with cancer** in 2012 (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, PTCL-NOS) 
and began treatments in 2018 including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
and an autologous bone marrow transplant in 2019.
My medical journey is chronicled on https://swharden.com/med/

> **July, 2022:**
> A recent CT scan indicated evidence of relapse. 
> Although I am not in immediate danger, 
> 3 years after my autologous bone marrow transplant it now seems that 
> I may require additional treatment at some point. 
> Currently things are moving slowly, 
> so my next course of treatment is not yet decided.
> I'll update this page as I learn more.

> **July, 2023:**
> Following-up one year after my last update, I'm happy to report that things
> are still moving very slowly. I was extremely concerned at this time last year 
> after freshly getting the "relapse" diagnosis, but now that I've gone a full year 
> without major changes in my medical condition, it means that I have a good chance of
> remaining stable for a long time to come.

> **January, 2024:**
> There is no evidence of additional progression at this time, 
> so I feel like I'm back on track for a full recovery!
> April 2024 marks the 5 year anniversary of my 
> bone marrow transplant, and if I get to that point
> without evidence of further progression I will be
> happy to consider myself cancer free!

> **June 11, 2024:**
> Five years have passed since I
> [left the bone marrow transplant unit](https://swharden.com/med/),
> and I am happy to report that I am still healthy!
> My immune system never fully recovered, but I'm stable now,
> and couldn't be happier with my outcome
> and the amazing medical team that supported me along the way.
> Although there will always be a chance that my weird immune system
> may act up again and require further treatment,
> the longer I go without issue the less likely that becomes.
> I'm looking forward to enjoying my life and am excited about my future!
