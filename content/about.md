**I'm Scott W Harden, and this is my personal website.** I use this space to share personal projects I work on and as a place to aggregate notes and documentation I collect along the way. My formal education is in molecular biology, dentistry, and neuroscience, but I am passionate about computer programming and electrical engineering.

## Medical Updates

**I was diagnosed with cancer** in 2012 (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, PTCL-NOS) 
and began treatments in 2018 including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
and an autologous bone marrow transplant in 2019.

**My medical updates:**

**About my disease:**
<br>
&bull; [Understanding Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ih0GTBGq7A)<br>
&bull; [Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Fact Sheet (PDF)](https://swharden.com/static/misc/about/ptcl.pdf)

**How to help:**
<br>
&bull; Join the [bone marrow donor registry](https://my.bethematch.org/s/join) - it's free and just requires a cheek swab! (US adults 18-40)

If this website hasn't been updated in a while, 
you can verify that I'm okay by seeing 
[recent activity on my GitHub account](https://github.com/swharden). 

I plan to remove this section from my about page after achieving 5 years cancer-free.

> **July, 2022:**
> A recent CT scan indicated evidence of relapse. 
> Although I am not in immediate danger, 
> 3 years after my autologous bone marrow transplant it now seems that 
> I may require additional treatment at some point. 
> Currently things are moving slowly, 
> so my next course of treatment is not yet decided.
> I'll update this page as I learn more.

> **July, 2023:**
> Following-up one year after my last update, I'm happy to report that things
> are still moving very slowly. I was extremely concerned at this time last year 
> after freshly getting the "relapse" diagnosis, but now that I've gone a full year 
> without major changes in my medical condition, it means that I have a good chance of
> remaining stable for a long time to come.

> **January, 2024:**
> There is no evidence of additional progression at this time, 
> so I feel like I'm back on track for a full recovery!
> April 2024 marks the 5 year anniversary of my 
> bone marrow transplant, and if I get to that point
> without evidence of further progression I will be
> happy to consider myself cancer free!
>
> **June 11, 2024:**
> Five years have passed since I
> [left the bone marrow transplant unit](https://swharden.com/med/),
> and I am happy to report that I am still healthy!
> My immune system never fully recovered, but I'm stable now,
> and couldn't be happier with my outcome
> and the amazing medical team that supported me along the way.
> Although there will always be a chance that my weird immune system
> may act up again and require further treatment,
> the longer I go without issue the less likely that becomes.
> I'm looking forward to enjoying my life and am excited about my future!
