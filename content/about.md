<strong>I'm Scott Harden, and this is my personal website.</strong> I use this space to share interesting projects I work on and as a place to aggregate notes and documentation I collect along the way. My formal education is in molecular biology, dentistry, and neuroscience, but I am passionate about computer programming, electrical engineering, and serving as a maintainer for a variety of open source hardware and software projects.

## Harden Technologies, LLC
**I develop custom software and hardware solutions** for individuals and organizations operating as Harden Technologies, LLC. I typically work on software projects related to data analytics and visualization or hardware projects related to embedded biomedical device design and prototyping, but I am always willing to consider interesting projects in any field. I also offer commissioned prioritization of features in open source libraries I maintain. If you have a project that could benefit from my services, inquire about my availability by reaching out via email: swharden@gmail.com

## Donate
Although virtually all of my work is shared as MIT-licensed free and open-source projects with no expectation of contribution or compensation, sometimes individuals and companies who benefit greatly from my work reach out to me asking how they can thank me with a monetary gift. I created https://swharden.com/donate/ to provide a way for those who wish to share their appreciation by sending a donation of any amount. Aside from putting a huge smile on my face, these donations go a long way toward covering the hosting costs and cloud bills required to keep my projects and websites ad-free, making the internet a better place for everyone!

## Media

<div class="col mb-3">
<strong>I was on the Modern .NET Show</strong> in December, 2024. 
Although my interview was spread across 3 episodes, 
the first episode is a great listen
for anyone interested in learning more about me, why I'm passionate
about software development, and why I love working on open source projects!

## Medical Updates

**I was diagnosed with cancer** in 2012 (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, PTCL-NOS) 
and began treatments in 2018 including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
and an autologous bone marrow transplant in 2019.
My medical journey is chronicled on https://swharden.com/med/

<details>
  
**About my disease:**
<br>
&bull; [Understanding Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ih0GTBGq7A)<br>
&bull; [Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Fact Sheet (PDF)](https://swharden.com/static/misc/about/ptcl.pdf)

**How to help:**
<br>
&bull; Join the [bone marrow donor registry](https://my.bethematch.org/s/join) - it's free and just requires a cheek swab! (US adults 18-40)

<!--
> **July, 2022:**
> A recent CT scan indicated evidence of relapse. 
> Although I am not in immediate danger, 
> 3 years after my autologous bone marrow transplant it now seems that 
> I may require additional treatment at some point. 
> Currently things are moving slowly, 
> so my next course of treatment is not yet decided.
> I'll update this page as I learn more.

> **July, 2023:**
> Following-up one year after my last update, I'm happy to report that things
> are still moving very slowly. I was extremely concerned at this time last year 
> after freshly getting the "relapse" diagnosis, but now that I've gone a full year 
> without major changes in my medical condition, it means that I have a good chance of
> remaining stable for a long time to come.

> **January, 2024:**
> There is no evidence of additional progression at this time, 
> so I feel like I'm back on track for a full recovery!
> April 2024 marks the 5 year anniversary of my 
> bone marrow transplant, and if I get to that point
> without evidence of further progression I will be
> happy to consider myself cancer free!
-->

> **June, 2024:**
> Five years have passed since I
> [left the bone marrow transplant unit](https://swharden.com/med/),
> and I am happy to report that I am still healthy!
> My immune system never fully recovered, but I'm stable now,
> and couldn't be happier with my outcome
> and the amazing medical team that supported me along the way.
> I'm looking forward to enjoying my life and am excited about my future!
<!--
> Although there will always be a chance that my weird immune system
> may act up again and require further treatment,
> the longer I go without issue the less likely that becomes.
-->

<!--
> **Dec, 2024:**
> Recent genetic testing indicated that I may have a mutation in a tumor suppressor
> gene which is associated with the development of blood cancers.
> Five and a half years after my bone marrow transplant I am still
> doing well, and although knowing about this mutation doesn't change
> much practically, it is satisfying to have something to point to as the likely
> reason the cancer started in the first place.
