**I'm Scott W Harden, and this is my personal website.** I use this space to share personal projects I work on and as a place to aggregate notes and documentation I collect along the way. My formal education is in molecular biology, dentistry, and neuroscience, but I am passionate about computer programming and electrical engineering.

## Medical Updates

**I was diagnosed with cancer** in 2012 (peripheral T-cell lymphoma, PTCL-NOS) 
and began treatments in 2018 including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
and an autologous bone marrow transplant. 

**My medical updates:**
<br>
&bull; https://swharden.com/med/

**About my disease:**
<br>
&bull; [Understanding Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ih0GTBGq7A)<br>
&bull; [Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Fact Sheet (PDF)](ptcl.pdf)

**How to help:**
<br>
&bull; Join the [bone marrow donor registry](https://my.bethematch.org/s/join) (for US adults 18-40, it's free and just requires a cheek swab!)

At the time of writing (early 2022) I am doing well, 
but the future of my disease remains somewhat uncertain. 
If this website hasn't been updated in a while, 
you can verify that I'm okay by seeing 
[recent activity on my GitHub account](https://github.com/swharden). 
~~My plan is to remove this message after achieving 5 years cancer-free.~~

> July, 2022:
> I am now classified as a patient with relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma. 
> Although I am not in any immediate danger, 
> 3 years after my autologous bone marrow transplant it now seems likely that 
> I will require additional treatment at some point. 
> Currently my disease remains indolent and things are moving slowly, 
> so my next course of treatment is not yet decided.
> I'll update this page and https://swharden.com/med as I learn more.
